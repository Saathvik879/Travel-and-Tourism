## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **HTML**: Semantic markup, accessibility attributes
- **CSS**: BEM methodology, mobile-first responsive design
- **JavaScript**: ES6+ features, clear function naming, comprehensive comments

### Coding Standards
```javascript
// Use descriptive variable names
const userCurrentLocation = getCurrentLocation();

// Add comments for complex logic
/**
 * Detects transportation mode based on speed and movement patterns
 * @param {Array} locationHistory - Array of GPS coordinates with timestamps
 * @returns {Object} Detected mode with confidence score
 */
function detectTransportationMode(locationHistory) {
    // Implementation...
}

// Use consistent error handling
try {
    const tripData = await saveTripToDatabase(trip);
    showSuccessMessage('Trip saved successfully');
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to save trip:', error);
    showErrorMessage('Could not save trip. Please try again.');
}
```

### Testing Requirements
- All new features must include tests
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Test on multiple browsers and devices
- Include accessibility testing

### Git Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with clear commit messages
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Submit a pull request with description
