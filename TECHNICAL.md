# NATPAC Travel Data Collection System - Technical Documentation

## System Architecture Overview

The NATPAC Travel Data Collection System is designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that can function both as a web application and a mobile app-like experience. The system follows a client-side architecture with local data storage and optional cloud synchronization.

## Core Components

### 1. Trip Tracking Engine
**Purpose**: Handles GPS-based location tracking and trip detection

**Key Functions**:
- Continuous GPS monitoring with configurable intervals
- Trip start/end detection using movement patterns
- Route recording and waypoint collection
- Battery-optimized tracking algorithms

**Implementation**:
```javascript
class TripTracker {
    constructor() {
        this.isTracking = false;
        this.currentTrip = null;
        this.locationHistory = [];
    }
    
    startTracking() {
        // Initialize GPS tracking
        // Set up movement detection
        // Start trip recording
    }
    
    detectTripEnd() {
        // Analyze movement patterns
        // Determine if trip has ended
        // Trigger trip completion
    }
}
```

### 2. Transportation Mode Detection
**Purpose**: Automatically classify the mode of transportation

**Detection Algorithm**:
- Speed analysis (walking: 0-8 km/h, cycling: 8-25 km/h, vehicle: >25 km/h)
- Movement pattern recognition
- GPS accuracy and consistency checks
- Machine learning classification

**Supported Modes**:
- Walking (🚶)
- Bicycle (🚲) 
- Motorcycle (🏍️)
- Car (🚗)
- Auto-rickshaw (🛺)
- Bus (🚌)
- Train (🚆)

### 3. Data Storage Layer
**Purpose**: Manages local and cloud data storage

**Local Storage**:
- Browser localStorage for app settings
- IndexedDB for trip data and large datasets
- Service Worker for offline functionality

**Data Schema**:
```sql
-- Trips Table
CREATE TABLE trips (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT,
    start_time DATETIME,
    end_time DATETIME,
    origin_lat REAL,
